# OpenCV-FacialBlur
Face detection and blurring with Opencv

### Introduction
This is an older model I made when I was learning about the OpenCV library and about Computer Vision in general. This model uses the Haar cascade from the opencv git (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades).

I wanted to complicate the project by adding a facial blur after the face has been detected. When this was first made, the program would only take in picture file inputs and apply the gaussian blur over the detected face. I have since updated it to using a live feed from a webcam instead.
